What this project will do

A marketplace for Plex Servers

A person who has a plex server will be able to put their server up for access - money stipulated by the owner - and a potential buyer will send their info and payment to access it.

-Plex Owner will describe what is on the server and how long the access is for

-Potential Buyer will agree to owner's terms, and send the payment. After the payment is cleared the details of how to access the server will be sent. Or if user just requests access to the xbox version of the plex app, then the user will need to send the 4 character PIN he/she gets from the app, and the owner will input it.
